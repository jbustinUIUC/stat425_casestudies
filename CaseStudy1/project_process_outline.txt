The process for the project so far:

1) Verify Data Structure, look for missingness, and name variables
2) Check corr for numeric variables
3) Transform predictors Highly correlated with total population (to per 100,000 people),
   drop total income (linear combo of population and percapita)
4) Check categorical variables for groups with low frequency (dropped county and state and kept region)
5) Build slr with total population (was a heavy hitter)
6) Build full model
7) Using EDA, p-values, and trial and error found a subset model that is not rejected
8) Test slr vs full and reject slr
9) Model Diagnostics - No high Cook's D but high leverage, bad high leverage, and outlier points, 
   fails homoscedacticity and normality
10) Tried Log linear - Doesn't help
11) Tried Box Cox - lambda is about 0.1, lambda of 0 is log linear and tried that already but 0 was
                    not in the 95% CI for lambda, tried 0.1 but it didn't help either
12) Manually evaluated plots and corr for each predictor (full model) and made transformations 
13) Reperformed model selection
14) diagnostics - down to 3 bad high leverage, 2 outliers and 0 high cook's D, plots look homoscedastic
                  and bell shaped but hypothesis tests still reject normality and homoscedasticity
